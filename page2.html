It is clear by now that married people, no matter what age group, tend to move away from the city while single people stay around the city. Consider the table below which demonstrates how single people and married people utilise space:
</p>
<br>
<table style="width: 60%">
<tr>
	<th> </th>
	<th> NOT MARRIED </th>
	<th> MARRIED </th>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td> ROOMS </td>
	<td> Using a bedroom as an example, the size for a single person would typically be smaller than a bedroom for a married couple.</td>
	<td> Besides the bedroom, if a couple has children or aer living with other family members, more rooms within the house is necessary.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td> OUTDOOR</td>
	<td> A balcony is sufficient enough, or, being close to a park is another option as an outdoor space for someone alone.</td>
	<td> Ideally, families would want a backyard to allow space for childern to play in or have family gatherings or even hang their laundry. </td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td> SERVICES AND GOODS </td>
	<td> Being near be the city area, there are a lot of cafes, clubs and attractions available and moer suitable for single people.</td>
	<td> On the other hand, married people are more inclines to places and events which are suitable for families and being near schools, cheap groceies and public transport for the children to get to and from places.</td>
</tr>

<p>However, the growing population and increase of housings have caused the floor space in Sydney homes to decrease. According to Kristin Brookfield, a HIA Development, this is due to the fact that there are less and less families which can afford large homes (Devine, 2015). At one point, space is not the only factor that is causing people to move away from the city but also the cost of buying a house near the city area.</p>
