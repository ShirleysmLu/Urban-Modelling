<h2> 4 | PROPERTY </h2>
<p>Besides the influence of marital status, property prices are another reason why both married and single people are located away from the city area. Property prices are increasing and as mentioned previously, over 5 years there is a huge difference in the median house price. From the graph below, this has caused a shift in population around the state between 2011 and 2016.</p>

<p>According to the 2016 Census, people in Surry Hills with an average of 1.4 families with children out of 3,173 families pay a median weekly rent of $550 from a median weekly household income of $2,144. On the other hand, looking into the Bankstown (North) area, their median weekly rent comes to $400 from a $1,120 median weekly household income. Also, it is recorded to have 4,032 families with an average of 1.9 with children. Their median weekly rent comes to $400 from a $1,120 median weekly household income. Liverpool has a value of 6,492 families and 1.8 average of families with children have a median weekly rent of $340 and median weekly household income of $1,088. From this and referring to the figure above, there are two conclusions, (1) median renting prices are lower away from the city area, the difference between Surry Hills and Liverpool is $210 per week and (2) the household weekly income also decreases as further away from the city but the average number of families increase too.</p> 

<p>Similar to an article, it has been shown that people aged between 25-34 years of age are also moving away from the city due to property prices as well as settling at a later age. (Duke, 2017). The article goes about how young people are focusing on things such as travelling and their career rather than forming a family and being ‘tied down’ by mortgage. </p>
